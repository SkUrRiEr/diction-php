 Major Changes From GNU Diction
--------------------------------

 * Eliminated "print sentences with certain characteristics" code from style.
 * Removed all C-isms and replaced them with equivalent (and simpler) PHP code
 * Split functionality out into classes.
 * Eliminated standalone functionality to make this a set of classes for text
   analysis, rather than a set of programs for the same.
 * Cleaned up unused variables, renamed methods to reflect their purpose, etc.
 * Fixed some major bugs in the sentence handling code.

 Future Goals
--------------

 * Fix bugs.
 * Port the diction functionality also.
