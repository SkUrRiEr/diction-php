 Diction-PHP
=============

This is a port and upgrade of the original GNU diction to PHP.

http://www.gnu.org/software/diction/diction.html

 Major Changes From GNU Diction
--------------------------------

 * Ported to PHP
 * Removed all C-isms and replaced them with equivalent (and simpler) PHP code
 * Split functionality out into classes.
 * Eliminated standalone functionality to make this a set of classes for text
   analysis, rather than a set of programs for the same.
 * Cleaned up unused variables, renamed methods to reflect their purpose, etc.

 Future Goals
--------------

 * Fix any remaining inconsistencies between the original code and the PHP port
   (see tests directory)
 * Port the diction functionality also.
 * Allow all stages of the processing to be enhanced through PHP's OO features.
 * Re-format code into a standard PHP style
 * Submit to PEAR.
