This file is a set of sentences to confuse and test the sentence parsing code in Sentence.php.

We're going to do things like omit ... randomly. Then we'll not actually finish... We're also going to try to do things like start sentences like this: ...yes, we're using ellipses in a vain attempt to confuse it. This is just here to check that the ellipsis handling code works properly.

What about sentence endings then? Surely it won't be confused by this!

"Even if I talk to you in quotation marks."

What's really interesting is when I start using abbreviations. Speaking of abbreviations, Dr. Matthews is especially fond of them. Not only that, but my network cable is 21 in. long.

How about sentence beginnings? what if I miss the capital?
